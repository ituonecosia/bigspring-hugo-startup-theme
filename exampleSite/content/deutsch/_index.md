    content: "Ecosia.org is a search engine that uses 80% of its profits (47.1% of
      its revenue) from advertising revenue to support local non-profit organizations
      focused on afforestation and tree planting projects. Currently Ecosia has 42
      tree-planting projects across 25 countries such as Peru, Brazil, Burkina Faso
      and Indonesia and to date it has planted <strong>more than 120 million trees</strong>.
      It states that on average it takes 45 internet searches to fund the\nplanting
      of a tree, and search results are provided by Bing and enhanced by the company's
      own algorithms. The company publishes its monthly financial reports on its sites
      and shares the green investments they make with their users. It has also committed
      itself to be a privacy-friendly search engine in 2018, and for this purpose,
      it is stated that personal data are not sold to advertisers and third party
      trackers are not used. "

    content: 'Ecosia on Campus is a worldwide campaign led by students to make Ecosia
      the default search engine for universities. When a university switches to Ecosia
      on campus computers, this has a huge impact and often results in thousands of
      trees being planted. During the 3-year campaign, 13 universities, including
      the University of Sussex, KU Leuven and Universidad Camilo Jos√© Cela, moved
      to Ecosia and 175,000 trees were planted thanks to the students. Campaigns are
      currently ongoing at 200 universities, including Yale and UC Berkeley. '
